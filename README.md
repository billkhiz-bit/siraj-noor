Built for the [Quran Foundation Hackathon 2026](https://hackathon.provisionlaunch.com) by Provision Launch × Quran Foundation. Fork of the original [Siraj](https://github.com/billkhiz-bit/siraj), which was built for Ramadan Hacks 2026.

## What is Siraj Noor?

Siraj Noor illuminates the structure, patterns, and geography of the Qur'an and Hadith through interactive 3D data visualisation — and now goes further by layering a personal companion experience on top. Bookmark ayahs from any 3D view, save them into collections, track your reading streak, reflect on verses, and watch your reading progress light up the Surah Ring. All personal data is stored on your Quran Foundation account (via the User APIs) so it travels with you across devices.

Most Islamic apps focus on reading and listening. Siraj Noor lets you *see* the data **and** build a lasting relationship with what you've explored.

## Mobile Responsive

Siraj is fully responsive across phones, tablets, and desktops. On mobile (<768px):
- Sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu
- 3D canvases and side panels stack vertically
- Map overlays resize to fit smaller screens
- Landing page stats wrap to multiple rows

Desktop layout is unchanged — all responsive behaviour uses the `md:` Tailwind breakpoint.
